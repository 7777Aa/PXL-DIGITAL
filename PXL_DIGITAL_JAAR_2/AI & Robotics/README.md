# Artificial Intelligence & Robotics
This repository containts all the study materials for the AI & Robotics course at PXL University of Applied Sciences and Arts. Each week has clear defined goals which need to be achieved by the end of the course.

The [official course information](https://ibamaflexweb.pxl.be/BMFUIDetailxOLOD.aspx?b=1&c=1&a=60023) is available on the iBaMaFlex system. The schedule is automatically added to your [personal schedule](http://mijnlessenrooster.pxl.be/).

## Important
**We really want as much input/feedback/... from you (the student) as possible!**

It's allowed to interrupt us during class. We appreciate 100% honest and direct feedback. On the other hand, we are fully aware we are _atypical_ lecturers. For some students, and that's perfectly normal, there still will be a barrier. Therefore, we created a complete anonymous [Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/QaVVy2EWPvk3hZNx2) to submit feedback, critique, requests for clarification, suggestions, etcetera. Please do use it! We will read it and use it accordingly.
