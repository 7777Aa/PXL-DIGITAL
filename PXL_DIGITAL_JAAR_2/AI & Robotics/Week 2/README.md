### Clarifications
- [**Graph Neighbourhood**](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphNeighborhood.html)
  
  During the lectures we use the term _neighbours_ in context of graphs 
  but didn't explain it at all. To fill in this void, we added the definition of Graph Neighbourhood below.

   From the super awesome [Mathworld Wolfram](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphNeighborhood.html) website:
   >  The graph neighborhood of a vertex v in a graph is the set of all the vertices adjacent to v including v itself.
   >
   > Note that while "graph neighborhood" generally includes vertices adjacent to v together with the vertex v itself, the term "graph neighbors" generally means vertices adjacent to v excluding v itself (e.g., Brouwer et al. 1989)

### Extra
* [**Binary Trees in Python: Introduction and Traversal Algorithms**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oL-0TdVy28)

  > In this video, we will go over the binary tree data structure. 
  > We then go over how to implement this data structure in Python. 
  > We then cover the three recursive depth-first search traversal algorithms (preorder, inorder, and postorder) 
  > and implement those recursively in Python.

* [**Working with Graph Algorithms in Python**](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/graph-algorithms-python)

   > This course focuses on how to represent a graph using three common classes of graph algorithms 
   > - the topological sort to sort vertices by precedence relationships, the shortest path algorithm, 
   > and finally the spanning tree algorithms.

### Clarification
Further extensions of A* and advanced techniques for path finding are part of the Research Project course. 

### Extra
- [**Compare A* with Dijkstra algorithm**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g024lzsknDo)

   From [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g024lzsknDo):
   > The project contains the Java implementation of the A* and Dijkstra path
   > search algorithms, which can be used alone in any application. A GUI demo
   > is provided for the visualization that animates the search progress, 
   > also shows the cost of the path and the number of nodes visited during 
   > the search, so the difference between the two algorithm could not be 
   > more clear.
